# PJSK SUS Chart Audio Path Fixer

Quick tool to help with fixing the audio path of SUS ([Sliding Universal Score](https://gist.github.com/kb10uy/c171c175ba913dc40a73c6ce69da9859) ) charts exports from
[PjskSUSPatcher](https://github.com/Qrael/PjskSUSPatcher) for use in a simulator like [Umiguri](https://umgr.inonote.jp/) (although there may be other usecases).

Drag and drop the ZIP in and follow the prompts to get the fixed SUS files.
